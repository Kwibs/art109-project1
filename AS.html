    Making this website was an experience to say the least, but we had fun brainstorming with how to implement an archive with a fun twist. I believe we included a nice personality to our project, with a clear showcase of elements we learned and a nice laugh. We came up with the idea for a tree chat log archive because its funny to imagine what the communication between trees would look like over time, and what it would look like to see the end of this chat log website with its final usersâ€™ chat logs. The meaning of this is to create a parallel between Funglr shutting down and the users no longer being able to communicate, with the process of deforestation. This archive and its chat logs also raise questions as to what we would do if we were going to lose communication with our closest friends forever.
